Data Sync and 3Scale in the MCP
-------------------------------

This is a guide for provisioning the 3scale service from the OpenShift service
catalog and integrating it with the Aerogear Sync service. The 3scale service
will provision an APIcast API Gateway that can be placed in front of other
services.

[[prerequisites]]
Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* An OpenShift cluster with:
** the MCP UI extension enabled
** Mobile Services available in the Service Catalog
** a Project containing the MCP Server
** Aerogear Sync provisioned in the Project

* A 3scale.net account

Provision 3scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3scale can be provisioned from the OpenShift Service catalog.

Navigate to the Service Catalog -> Mobile -> Services -> 3scale.

The 3scale service requires you to already have a 3scale account. You will need
to enter your 3scale admin URL without any protocol (http, https) e.g. example-admin.3scale.com.
You will also need a 3scale access token, these can be created by following
link:https://support.3scale.net/docs/accounts/tokens[this guide]. Finally you
will need the ID for API calls of the 3scale service you'd like to integrate
with.

A number of tasks will be performed while provisioning:

* A 3scale APIcast pod will be provisioned and configured to use the 3scale
account provided in the Service Catalog.
* An App Key will be created. This will be provided along with the App ID to
the headers object in the Mobile Core SDK.

[[integrate-3scale-with-data-sync]]
Integrate 3scale with Data Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the 3scale service has finished provisioning it will be available as an
integration in the Service Integrations tab of the Aerogear Sync Server.
Enabling the service integration is done via the 'bind' playbook in the 3Scale APB.
The 'bind' playbook will do the following:

* Configure the 3Scale Service for App ID/Key Auth with a Self Managed APIcast i.e. the APICast is in our namespace.
* Configure the 3Scale Service Proxy settings to proxy on to the Aerogear Sync Server in our namepsace.
* Configure GET & POST Mappings for the Service. The mappings are simple with any GET or POST request getting proxied on to the Aerogear Sync Server. It is possible to manage mappings at a more granular level afterwards via the 3Scale Admin Portal.
* Promote the Proxy Configuration to production so the APICast in our namespace will use it.
* Get the App ID that our Mobile App will use with every request. This is stored in the `fh-sync-server` secret.
* Generate an App Key that our Mobile App will use with every request. This is stored in the `fh-sync-server` secret. An App Key can be revoked/regenerated as needed from the 3Scale Admin Portal. If regenerating, the key will need to be manually updated in the `fh-sync-server` secret.

Ultimately, enabling the integration will change the URL Mobile Apps use to connect to the Sync Server to an APIcast URL.
It will also provide the App ID and App Key headers required to communicate with APIcast.

[source,json]
----
{
  "fh-sync-server": {
    "config": {
      "headers": {
        "app_id": "exampleid",
        "app_key": "examplekey"
      },
      "uri": "https://apicast-example-url"
    },
    "name": "fh-sync-server"
  }
}
----

A Cordova app can use the Mobile Core SDK to retrieve this config and ensure
sync uses it when available.

[source,js]
----
const sync = require('fh-sync-js');
const mobileCore = require('fh-mobile-core');
const mcpConfig = require('../mcpConfig.json');

function buildSyncCloudHandler(cloudUrl, options) {
  return function (params, success, failure) {
    var url = cloudUrl + params.dataset_id;
    var headers = (options.headers || {});
    Request({
      method: 'POST',
      uri: url,
      headers: headers,
      body: params.req,
      json: true
    })
    .then((res) => {
      return success(res);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      return failure(err);
    });
  }
}

mobileCore.configure(mcpConfig).then((config) => {
  const syncConfig = config.getConfigFor('fh-sync-server');
  const syncCloudUri = syncConfig.uri + '/sync/';

  // Initialise sync ...

  const syncCloudHandler = buildSyncCloudHandler(syncCloudUri, {
    // Headers will either contain the App ID and App Key headers or be empty.
    headers: syncConfig.headers
  });
  // Make Sync use syncCloudHandler to make requests and handle responses.
  sync.setCloudHandler(syncCloudHandler);

  // Intitialise rest of app ...
});
----

Before the 3scale integration is made the app will make requests directly to
the Aerogear Sync Server without `app_id` and `app_key` headers. Once the
integration is made the app will start sending requests to APIcast with the
headers included. This will allow APIcast to send metrics about the apps
requests to 3scale.

[[viewing-requests-in-3scale]]
Viewing requests in 3scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the 3scale integration is enabled on the Aerogear Sync Server. Metrics
about requests being made to the server will be visible in 3scale. When signed
in to 3scale an 'Analytics' section will be available for the service. This
contains metrics about requests being sent to the Sync Server through the
APIcast service.
